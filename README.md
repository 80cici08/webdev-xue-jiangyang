# WebAppMaker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4

###Something about the author
I'm a graduate student of 2019 spring at Northeastern. Before that, I've worked in HUAWEI for three years as a test engineer. Our major product is Software Defined Network(SDN) controller, an application that controls network devices and manages flow control. I participated in the web testing(mainly Restful API testing) and performance testing of the product. We also wrote automated testing cases with Ruby.
